<P style="font-size: 30px; color:rgb(23, 20, 20);"><stong>Earth and Mars</stong> are situated within the <em>Goldilocks zone</em>, which means that they are at a distance from sun where water can exist in liquid state since itâ€™s neither too hot, not too cold.
Both the planets are rocky planets, unlike Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn and Uranus, which are gas planets.Both the planets have moons orbiting them.</P>
<p style="font-size: 30px; color:rgb(23, 20, 20);">At one time, astronomers believed the surface of Mars was crisscrossed by canal systems. This in turn gave rise to speculation that Mars was very much like Earth, capable of supporting life and home to a native civilization. But as human satellites and rovers began to conduct flybys and surveys of the planet, this vision of Mars quickly dissolved, replaced by one in which the Red Planet was a cold, desiccated and lifeless world.</p>
