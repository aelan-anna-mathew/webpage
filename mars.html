<p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun</strong> – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Mars is easiest to observe when it and the Sun are in opposite directions in the sky—i.e., at opposition—because it is then high in the sky and shows a fully lighted face. Successive oppositions occur about every 26 months. Oppositions can take place at different points in the <strong>orbit.</strong> Those best for viewing occur when the planet is closest to the Sun, and so also to Earth, because Mars is then at its brightest and largest. Close oppositions occur roughly every 15 years.</p>
